    <h1>Javascript for Java/C# Developers</h1>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This is a short introduction to Javascript for people that are already well-versed
            in object-oriented class-based programming languages such as Java, C#, or C++. I will 
            be going over what prior knowledge will be useful in Javascript, and the prior knowledge
            that can get you in trouble.
        </p>

        <p>
            Javascript is frequently regarded with disdain by people used to other languages. Many
            programmers go into Javascript with no preparation and assume their OO techniques will work, only
            to run into various issues due to the inner workings of the language. I encourage the reader to 
            view Javascript as a full language in its own right, instead of as a tool to manipulate web pages.
        </p>

        <h3>What Javascript is</h3>

        <p>
            Javascript is a dynamically typed scripting language that primarily powers the web, 
            though its usage outside of the browser is rapidly increasing. Javascript was created in 
            10 days by Brendan Eich. The syntax of Javascript is derived from C, just as in Java/C#/C++.
        </p>

        <p>
            Javascript requires a runtime environment to execute in. This is generally the web browser,
            but standalone engines do exist, such as the one that powers node. <i>Javascript</i> is
            a trademarked name, and the more generic <i>ECMAScript</i> may be used when referring to the language.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Javascript has first-class functions (functions can be passed as variables).</li>
            <li>Javascript functions can be anonymous (they may have no name).</li>
            <li>Javascript functions can be invoked immediately.</li>
            <li>Javascript only has 64-bit floating points for numbers (no integers).</li>
            <li>Javascript has closures (a function plus its execution environment that can be passed around).</li>
            <li>Javascript is dynamically typed.</li>
            <li>Javascript is duck typed (two objects with the same property name, but different logic or types, are treated similarly).</li>
            <li>Javascript has automatic semicolon insertion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Javascript is not</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Javascript is not a class-based language (it uses prototypes instead).</li>
            <li>Javascript is not related to the <i>Java</i> language (the name is due to marketing).</li>
            <li>Javascript is not compiled (it is interpreted).</li>
            <li>Javascript is not purely functional (but has functional features).</li>
            <li>Javascript is not typed (no checking of data types).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Hopefully these differences can help convince you to take the language seriously.
